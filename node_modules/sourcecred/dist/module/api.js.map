SourceCred uses this graph to model all of the contributions\n * that make up a project, and the relationships between those contributions.\n *\n * If you aren't familiar with computer science graphs, now would be a good\n * time to refresh. See [this StackOverflow answer][1] for an introduction, and\n * [Wikipedia][2] for a more thorough overview. This Graph is used by\n * SourceCred as a \"Contribution Graph\", where every node is a contribution or\n * contributor (e.g. a pull request, or a GitHub user identity) and every edge\n * represents a connection between contributions or contributors (e.g. a pull\n * request contains a comment, or a comment is authored by a user).\n *\n * [1]: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/168058/what-are-graphs-in-laymens-terms#168067\n * [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)\n *\n * The Graph serves a simple function: it keeps track of which Nodes exist, and\n * what Edges join those nodes to each other. Nodes and Edges are both identified\n * by Addresses; specifically, `NodeAddressT`s and `EdgeAddressT`s.\n *\n * In both cases, addresses are modeled as arrays of strings. For example,\n * you might want to give an address to your favorite node. You can do so as\n * follows:\n *\n * const myAddress: NodeAddressT = NodeAddress.fromParts([\"my\", \"favorite\"])\n *\n * Edge Addresses are quite similar, except you use the EdgeAddress module.\n *\n * We model addresses as arrays of strings so that plugins can apply\n * hierarchical namespacing for the address. In general, for any address, the\n * first piece should be the name of the organization that owns the plugin, and\n * the second piece should be the name of the plugin. Pieces thereafter are\n * namespaced by the plugin's internal logic. For example, SourceCred has a\n * Git plugin, and that plugin produces addresses like\n * [\"sourcecred\", \"git\", \"commit\", \"9cba0e9e212a287ce26e8d7c2d273e1025c9f9bf\"].\n *\n * This enables \"prefix matching\" for finding only certain types of nodes. For\n * example, if we wanted to find every Git commit in the graph, we\n * could use the following code:\n *\n * const commitPrefix = NodeAddress.fromParts([\"sourcecred\", \"git\", \"commit\"]);\n * const commitNodes = graph.nodes({prefix: commitPrefix});\n *\n * The graph represents nodes as the `Node` data type, which includes an\n * address (NodeAddressT) as well as a few other fields that are needed for\n * calculating and displaying cred. The Graph is intended to be a lightweight\n * data structure, so only data directly needed for cred analysis is included.\n * If there's other data you want to store (e.g. the full text of posts that\n * are tracked in the graph), you can use the node address as a key for a\n * separate database.\n *\n * Edges are represented by `Edge` objects. They have `src` and `dst` fields.\n * These fields represent the \"source\" of the edge and the \"destination\" of the\n * edge respectively, and both fields contain `NodeAddressT`s. The edge also\n * has its own address, which is an `EdgeAddressT`.\n *\n * Graphs are allowed to contain Edges whose `src` or `dst` are not present.\n * Such edges are called 'Dangling Edges'. An edge may convert from dangling to\n * non-dangling (if it is added before its src or dst), and it may convert from\n * non-dangling to dangling (if its src or dst are removed).\n *\n * Supporting dangling edges is important, because it means that we can require\n * metadata be present for a Node (e.g. its creation timestamp), and still\n * allow graph creators that do not know a node's metadata to create references\n * to it. (Of course, they still need to know the node's address).\n *\n * Here's a toy example of creating a graph:\n *\n * ```js\n * const prAddress = NodeAddress.fromParts([\"pull_request\", \"1\"]);\n * const prDescription = \"My Fancy Pull Request\"\n * const pr: Node = {address: prAddress, description: prDescription, timestampMs: +Date.now()}\n * const myAddress = NodeAddress.fromParts([\"user\", \"decentralion\"]);\n * const myDescription = \"@decentralion\"\n * const me: Node = {addess: myAddress, description: myDescription, timestampMs: null}\n * const authoredAddress = EdgeAddress.fromParts([\"authored\", \"pull_request\", \"1\"]);\n * const edge = {src: me, dst: pr, address: authoredAddress, timestampMs: +Date.now()};\n *\n * const g = new Graph();\n * g.addNode(pr);\n * g.addNode(me);\n * g.addEdge(edge);\n * ```\n *\n * Graph has a number of accessor methods:\n * - `hasNode` to check if a node address is in the Graph\n * - `node` to retrieve a node by its address\n * - `nodes` to iterate over the nodes in the graph\n * - `hasEdge` to check if an edge address is in the Graph\n * - `isDanglingEdge` to check if an edge is dangling\n * - `edge` to retrieve an edge by its address\n * - `edges` to iterate over the edges in the graph\n * - `neighbors` to find all the edges and nodes adjacent to a node\n *    (also supports filtering by direction, by node prefix, or edge prefix)\n *\n * The Graph also has a few other convenience methods, like toJSON/fromJSON\n * for serialization, and `Graph.merge` for combining multiple graphs.\n */\nexport opaque type NodeAddressT: string = string;\nexport opaque type EdgeAddressT: string = string;\nexport const NodeAddress: AddressModule<NodeAddressT> = (makeAddressModule({\n  name: \"NodeAddress\",\n  nonce: \"N\",\n  otherNonces: new Map().set(\"E\", \"EdgeAddress\"),\n}): AddressModule<string>);\nexport const EdgeAddress: AddressModule<EdgeAddressT> = (makeAddressModule({\n  name: \"EdgeAddress\",\n  nonce: \"E\",\n  otherNonces: new Map().set(\"N\", \"NodeAddress\"),\n}): AddressModule<string>);\n\n/**\n * Represents a node in the graph.\n */\nexport type Node = {|\n  +address: NodeAddressT,\n  // Brief (ideally oneline) description for the node.\n  // Markdown is supported.\n  +description: string,\n  // When this node was created.\n  // Should be null for a \"timeless\" node, where we don't\n  // want to model that node as having been created at any particular\n  // point in time.

In\n * practice, projects can call these tokens anything they want, but we will\n * refer to the tokens as \"Grain\" throughout the codebase. The conserved\n * properties of all Grains are that they are minted/distributed based on cred\n * scores, and that they can be used to Boost contributions in a cred graph.\n *\n * We track Grain using big integer arithmetic, so that we can be precise with\n * Grain values and avoid float imprecision issues. Following the convention of\n * ERC20 tokens, we track Grain at 18 decimals of precision, although we can\n * make this project-specific if there's a future need.\n *\n * At rest, we represent Grain as strings. This is a convenient decision around\n * serialization boundaries, so that we can just directly stringify objects containing\n * Grain values and it will Just Work. The downside is that we need to convert them to/fro\n * string representations any time we need to do Grain arithmetic, which could create\n * perf hot spots. If so, we can factor out the hot loop and do them in a way\n * that has less overhead. You can see context for this decision in [#1936] and [#1938].\n *\n * Ideally, we would just use the native [BigInt] type. However, at time of\n * writing it's not well supported by [flow] or Safari, so we use the\n * big-integer library. That library delegates out to native BigInt when\n * available, so this should be fine.\n *\n * Since the big-integer library does have a sensible `toString` method defined\n * on the integers, we could switch to representing Grain at rest via\n * big-integers rather than as strings. However, this would require re-writing\n * a lot of test code.

mint excess Cred for its dependencies.\n *\n * To learn about the semantics of the dependencies system, read the module\n * docstring for core/bonusMinting.js\n *\n * At a high level, this config type allows the instance maintainer to specify\n * identities (usually PROJECT-type identities) to mint extra Cred over time,\n * as a fraction of the baseline instance Cred.\n *\n * In the future, we'll likely build a UI to manage this config. However, right\n * now it's designed for hand-editability. Also, we really want to be able to\n * ship a default config that adds a SourceCred account (if one doesn't already\n * exist), activates it (if it was just created), and then flows it some Cred.\n *\n * With that in mind, here's how the config works:\n * - User makes a new config, specifying a name for the identity. The user does\n *   not manually write in an id.\n * - The config is validated against the ledger. If the config has an id, we\n *   verify that there's a matching identity in the ledger with that name\n *   (erroring if not). If the config doesn't have an id, we check if there is\n *   an identity in the ledger with that name. If there is, we write the id\n *   into the config. If there isn't, we create a new identity with the name,\n *   activate it (if told to do so by the config), and then write the id into\n *   the config.\n * - Afterwards, we save the config (which is guaranteed to have an id) back to\n *   disk.\n *\n * You'll note that the state in the config is a mix of human generated\n * (choosing the name) and automatically maintained (the id). It's something of\n * a weird compromise, but it accomplishes the design objective of having state\n * that's easy for humans to write by hand, but also tracks the vital\n * information by identity id (which is immutable) rather than by name (which\n * is re-nameable).\n *\n * Note that at present, when the identity in question is re-named, the config\n * must be manually updated to account for the rename. In the future (when the\n * config is automatically maintained) we'll remove this requirement. (Likely\n * we'll stop tracking the identities by name at all in the config; that's an\n * affordance to make the files generatable by hand.)\n */\nimport * as C from \"../util/combo\";\nimport {Ledger} from \"../core/ledger/ledger\";\nimport {\n  type TimestampISO,\n  timestampISOParser,\n  fromISO,\n  toISO,\n} from \"../util/timestamp\";\nimport {type IdentityId, type Name, nameParser} from \"../core/identity\";\nimport {parser as uuidParser} from \"../util/uuid\";\nimport {type BonusPolicy} from \"../core/bonusMinting\";\n\n// A finite nonnegative value (usually in range [0, 1]) which specifies how\n// much extra Cred to mint for a given dependency, as a proportion of the raw\n// contributor Cred in the instance.

The core\n * idea for bonus minting is that extra Cred is conjured out of thin air (as a\n * \"bonus\") and distributed to a chosen recipient.

For example, we\n * would like users of SourceCred to mint some extra Cred and flow it to the\n * SourceCred project.\n *\n * In CredRank, we handle this by creating extra nodes in the graph which mint\n * the bonus Cred, and it flows directly from those nodes to the intended\n * recipients.\n *\n * The total amount of Cred that may be minted is unbounded; for example, if\n * the dependencies have a total weight of 0.2, then the total Cred will be\n * 120% of the base Cred, but if the dependencies had a total weight of 1, then\n * the total Cred would be double the base Cred. This was a deliberate design\n * decision so that dependency minting would feel \"non-rival\", i.e. there is\n * not a fixed budget of dependency cred that must be split between the\n * dependencies.

The\n   code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the\n   symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the\n   symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order\n   for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n   symbol does not occur in this code.\n\n   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n   table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by\n   the caller.\n\n   The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding\n   the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any\n   codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead\n   at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the\n   decoding tables.\n   */\n\n  /* accumulate lengths for codes (assumes lens[] all in 0..MAXBITS) */\n  for (len = 0; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    count[len] = 0;\n  }\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    count[lens[lens_index + sym]]++;\n  }\n\n  /* bound code lengths, force root to be within code lengths */\n  root = bits;\n  for (max = MAXBITS; max >= 1; max--) {\n    if (count[max] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root > max) {\n    root = max;\n  }\n  if (max === 0) {                     /* no symbols to code at all */\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;  //here.op = (var char)64;    /* invalid code marker */\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;   //here.bits = (var char)1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;   //here.val = (var short)0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n    opts.bits = 1;\n    return 0;     /* no symbols, but wait for decoding to report error */\n  }\n  for (min = 1; min < max; min++) {\n    if (count[min] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root < min) {\n    root = min;\n  }\n\n  /* check for an over-subscribed or incomplete set of lengths */\n  left = 1;\n  for (len = 1; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    left <<= 1;\n    left -= count[len];\n    if (left < 0) {\n      return -1;\n    }        /* over-subscribed */\n  }\n  if (left > 0 && (type === CODES || max !== 1)) {\n    return -1;                      /* incomplete set */\n  }\n\n  /* generate offsets into symbol table for each length for sorting */\n  offs[1] = 0;\n  for (len = 1; len < MAXBITS; len++) {\n    offs[len + 1] = offs[len] + count[len];\n  }\n\n  /* sort symbols by length, by symbol order within each length */\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    if (lens[lens_index + sym] !== 0) {\n      work[offs[lens[lens_index + sym]]++] = sym;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /*\n   Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being\n   filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff\n   with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop\n   bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,\n   those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to\n   fill the table with replicated entries.\n\n   root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds\n   root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index\n   of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a\n   new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is\n   being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.\n\n   When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the\n   code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length\n   counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are\n   entered in the tables.\n\n   used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the\n   provided *table space.
